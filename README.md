Documenting my adventures with CS50

Hi!

Shar-Narne here, trying to make the most of my social isolation by learning how to code. My income has been basically cut in half since my job is people facing and quite frankly I'm just waiting for it to be cut even more. I figured it was jsut as good a time as any to learn a new skill and who knows, maybe in the future it'll lead to a job. 

Also, I've never tried moon tacos but I'd be interested in the experience.
